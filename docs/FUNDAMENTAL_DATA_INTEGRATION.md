# Fundamental Data Integration

## ‚úÖ What We've Accomplished

We successfully integrated **comprehensive fundamental financial data** into the US Industrial Value Chain Platform using the **Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API**.

### Companies with Complete Fundamental Data

- Total Assets: $135.16B
- Total Equity: $3.33B

**Cash Flow:**

## üé® UI Components

### Financial Statements Component

We created a comprehensive `FinancialStatements` component with **5 tabs**:

1. **Income Tab** - Revenue, profits, margins, EPS
2. **Balance Tab** - Assets, liabilities, equity, debt
3. **Cash Flow Tab** - Operating CF, CapEx, Free CF
4. **Key Metrics Tab** - P/E, ROE, ROA, Debt/Equity
5. **Ratios Tab** - Liquidity, profitability, and efficiency ratios

Location: `components/company/FinancialStatements.tsx`

### Company Page Integration

The company detail pages (`app/companies/[ticker]/page.tsx`) now:

- Fetch all data from **Supabase** (cached, no API calls needed)
- Display current stock price with change percentage
- Show full financial statements in interactive tabs
- Include company profile and description

## üì° FMP API Integration

### Endpoints Used

We use the **new `/stable/` endpoints** from FMP:

1. `/stable/quote` - Current stock price and market data
2. `/stable/profile` - Company profile information
3. `/stable/income-statement` - Annual income statements (5 years)
4. `/stable/balance-sheet-statement` - Annual balance sheets (5 years)
5. `/stable/cash-flow-statement` - Annual cash flow statements (5 years)
6. `/stable/key-metrics-ttm` - Key financial metrics (TTM)
7. `/stable/ratios-ttm` - Financial ratios (TTM)

### API Call Usage

Each company import uses **~7 API calls**:

- 1 for quote
- 1 for profile
- 1 for income statement
- 1 for balance sheet
- 1 for cash flow
- 1 for key metrics
- 1 for financial ratios

With **250 free calls per day**, we can import **~35 companies per day**.

### Import Script

Location: `scripts/import-fundamentals-to-supabase.ts`

Run with:

```bash
npm run import:fundamentals
```

This script:

- Fetches comprehensive data from FMP
- Stores everything in Supabase `companies` table
- Rate limits to 2 seconds between requests
- Provides detailed progress logging

## üíæ Database Schema

The `companies` table stores all data in a JSONB `data` column:

```typescript
data: {
  // Current quote
  quote: { price, change, changesPercentage, volume, marketCap, pe, eps, ... },

  // Company profile
  profile: { companyName, cik, isin, cusip, ipoDate, beta, ... },

  // Latest income statement
  incomeStatement: { date, revenue, netIncome, grossProfit, operatingIncome, eps, ebitda, ... },

  // Latest balance sheet
  balanceSheet: { date, totalAssets, totalLiabilities, totalEquity, cash, debt, ... },

  // Latest cash flow
  cashFlow: { date, operatingCashFlow, capitalExpenditure, freeCashFlow, dividendsPaid, ... },

  // Key metrics (TTM)
  keyMetrics: { peRatioTTM, roeTTM, roaTTM, debtToEquityTTM, ... },

  // Financial ratios (TTM)
  ratios: { currentRatioTTM, quickRatioTTM, grossProfitMarginTTM, netProfitMarginTTM, ... },

  // Historical financials (5 years)
  historicalFinancials: {
    incomeStatements: [...],
    balanceSheets: [...],
    cashFlowStatements: [...]
  },

  last_updated: "2025-10-16T..."
}
```

## üöÄ Data Strategy

### Current Status

- **Total companies in database**: 29
- **Companies with fundamentals**: 6
- **Companies with basic quote only**: 23

### Why Only 6 Companies Have Fundamentals?

The FMP free tier has **limited ticker coverage**. When we tried to fetch fundamentals for other companies, we got **402 Payment Required** errors, indicating those tickers require a paid plan.

### Data Strategy Options

#### Option 1: ‚úÖ Use What We Have (Recommended for MVP)

**Pros:**

- 6 companies with **complete, real fundamental data**
- Covers key industries (Tech, Healthcare, Aerospace, Fintech)
- No ongoing costs
- Perfect for demonstrating the platform

**Cons:**

- Limited to 6 companies with fundamentals
- 23 companies only have basic quote data

#### Option 2: Upgrade FMP Plan

**Pricing:**

- **Starter Plan**: $29/month - More tickers, 750 calls/day
- **Professional Plan**: $99/month - Full coverage, 5000 calls/day

**Pros:**

- Access to all 101 tickers
- More API calls for frequent updates
- Historical data going back further

**Cons:**

- Monthly recurring cost
- May be overkill for MVP

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

- Use **6 companies with fundamentals** as featured case studies
- Show **23 companies with basic quotes** as "lite" profiles
- Focus UI on the 6 companies with rich data
- Add more as budget allows

### Recommended Approach for MVP

**Focus on the 6 companies with fundamentals:**

1. **Feature them prominently** on the homepage
2. **Use them in demos** to showcase financial analysis capabilities
3. **Hide fundamental tabs** for companies without the data
4. **Add "Premium Data" badges** to companies with full fundamentals
5. **Expand gradually** as needed (can add ~35 companies per day within free tier)

## üìà Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Daily Updates**

   - Schedule a daily job to refresh quote data
   - Only costs 1 API call per company for quotes
   - 29 companies = 29 calls/day (well within free tier)

2. **Quarterly Fundamentals Updates**

   - Refresh income/balance/cash flow data quarterly
   - Only when companies report earnings
   - Can batch over several days

3. **Add More Companies**

   - Gradually import more companies
   - Stay within 250 calls/day limit
   - Prioritize by industry importance

4. **Data Visualization**

   - Charts showing 5-year trends
   - Comparison across companies
   - Industry averages and benchmarks

5. **AI-Powered Insights**
   - Analyze financial trends
   - Identify supply chain risks
   - Suggest value chain connections

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Current Architecture

```
FMP API (250 calls/day free)

Supabase (PostgreSQL database)
    ‚Üì
Next.js App (fetches from Supabase)
    ‚Üì
User sees instant data (no API calls needed!)
```

### Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Fast page loads** - No API calls during user requests
- ‚úÖ **No rate limits** - Data served from Supabase
- ‚úÖ **Consistent data** - All users see same cached data
