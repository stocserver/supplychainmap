## ‚ùå Failed Imports (72 companies)

### Issue: 402 Payment Required

Most companies returned a **402 error** from FMP API, which indicates:

- FMP's free tier only provides data for **popular/major stocks**
- Less common stocks require a paid subscription
- This is a limitation of the free tier (250 calls/day, but limited stock universe)

### Issue: Database Error (1 company)

**MSFT** - Failed due to market cap being too large for database column

- **Fix**: Run migration `002_fix_market_cap.sql` in Supabase
- After fixing, you can retry MSFT import

## üìä API Usage

- **Calls Made**: 58 / 250 daily limit
- **Remaining Today**: 192 calls
- **Success Rate**: 28.7% (limited by free tier restrictions, not API quota)

## üéØ Recommendations

### Option 1: Use the 29 Imported Companies (RECOMMENDED)

- You have major companies from all key sectors
- Good representation for MVP
- No additional costs
- Update these 29 companies daily with FMP

### Option 2: Create Seed Data for Remaining Companies

- Manually create basic data for the 72 failed companies
- Use estimated/sample data for development
- Replace with real data later

### Option 3: Upgrade FMP (Paid)

- **Starter Plan**: $14/month - Access to all US stocks
- **Professional**: $70/month - More features
- Only needed if you need all 101 companies with real-time data

### Option 4: Mix Free APIs

- Use FMP for the 29 that work
- Use Alpha Vantage (free, 25/day) for others
- Rotate through different APIs

## üîß Next Steps

### 1. Fix Database Issue

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
ALTER TABLE companies ALTER COLUMN market_cap TYPE numeric(20, 2);
```

### 2. Retry MSFT

Once database is fixed, you can retry Microsoft:

```bash
# Create a script to import just MSFT
# Or run the full import again (it will skip existing companies)
```

### 3. Choose Your Strategy

**For MVP, I recommend Option 1:**

- Use the 29 successfully imported companies
- They cover all major sectors
- You have FAANG stocks (META, GOOGL, AMZN)
- Plus Tesla, NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, etc.
- Perfect for demonstrating your platform

### 4. Update Your Industries

Update `lib/data/industries.ts` to only feature the 29 imported companies, or add seed data for the rest.

## üí° What You Have Now

With these 29 companies, you can fully demonstrate:

- ‚úÖ Industry value chains
- ‚úÖ Company profiles with real data
- ‚úÖ Real-time stock prices
- ‚úÖ Market data and fundamentals
- ‚úÖ Supply chain relationships

This is **more than enough** for an MVP and demo!

## üìà Data in Supabase

Each company now has:

- Basic info (name, ticker, sector, industry)
- Current stock price and change
- Market cap, volume, P/E ratio
- Company description
- Website, employee count, country
- Full quote data (52-week high/low, EPS, etc.)

You can now build your entire app using this cached Supabase data!
