## ‚ùå What Doesn't Work (Anymore)

- **Issue**: All stock quote/profile endpoints are now "legacy"
- **Requires**: Paid subscription ($14+/month)

## ‚úÖ What DOES Work

### **Option 1: Seed Data (RECOMMENDED for MVP)** ‚≠ê

**Best for:** Development, MVP, Demo

**Approach:**

1. Create static JSON file with your 150 featured companies
2. Store in Supabase once
3. Build all features without API dependency
4. Add real-time data later when you have users/revenue

**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ Works immediately
- ‚úÖ No API costs
- ‚úÖ No rate limits
- ‚úÖ Consistent data for development
- ‚úÖ Perfect for UI/UX development

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// lib/data/seed-companies.json
{
  "AAPL": {
    "name": "Apple Inc.",
    "price": 175.50,
    "sector": "Technology",
    ...
  }
}
```

### **Option 2: Alpha Vantage**

**Best for:** Small-scale production

**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ Still offers free tier
- ‚úÖ 25 API calls/day (FREE)
- ‚úÖ No credit card required

**Cons:**

- ‚ùå Very limited (25 calls/day)
- ‚ùå 5 calls per minute limit
- ‚ùå Not enough for active users

**Use case:** Background job that updates 25 stocks per day

### **Option 3: IEX Cloud**

**Best for:** Production with budget

**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ 50,000 messages/month (FREE)
- ‚úÖ Reliable and fast
- ‚úÖ Good documentation

**Cons:**

- ‚ùå Requires credit card (even for free tier)
- ‚ùå Will charge if you exceed free tier

### **Option 4: Twelve Data**

**Best for:** Alternative free option

**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ 800 API calls/day (FREE)
- ‚úÖ Real-time data
- ‚úÖ No credit card required

**Cons:**

- ‚ùå Rate limited (8 calls/minute)
- ‚ùå Less comprehensive than FMP

**Sign up:** https://twelve data.com/pricing

### **Option 5: Polygon.io**

**Best for:** Production (requires payment)

**Free Tier:**

- Delayed data (15 min delay)
- Unlimited API calls
- Good for non-real-time apps

**Paid:** $99/month for real-time

## üéØ My Strong Recommendation

**For your Supply Chain Map:**

### Phase 1: Development (NOW)

Use **Seed Data**:

1. I'll create a seed file with sample data for 150 companies
2. One-time import to Supabase
3. Build all features using this data
4. No API headaches, no costs

### Phase 2: Soft Launch

Use **Alpha Vantage** (Free):

1. Background cron job updates 25 stocks/day
2. After 6 days, all 150 stocks updated once
3. Rotate through stocks daily
4. Good enough for early users

### Phase 3: Scale

When you have revenue:

1. Upgrade to **Polygon.io** ($99/month)
2. Or **IEX Cloud** paid tier
3. Real-time data for all users

## üìù Next Steps

Would you like me to:

**A) Create Seed Data** (Recommended)

- Create JSON file with 150 companies
- Sample data for all your featured tickers
- Script to import to Supabase
- **You can start building immediately**

**B) Setup Alpha Vantage**

- Free tier (25 calls/day)
- Good for background updates
- Can supplement seed data

**C) Setup Twelve Data**

- Free tier (800 calls/day)
- Better than Alpha Vantage
- Still rate limited

**I strongly recommend Option A (Seed Data)** - it's the fastest way to get your app working and you can add real APIs later when you need them.

What would you like me to do?
