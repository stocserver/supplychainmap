# Income Statement Data Check - Summary

## ✅ FINAL RESULT: FMP Income Statement Data is Being Fetched Correctly

The FMP API is working properly and returning all necessary income statement data. We identified and **fixed two mapping issues** in the data import process.

---

## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing Profit Margin Ratios ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** FMP API doesn't return calculated ratios (grossProfitRatio, operatingIncomeRatio, netIncomeRatio)  
**Solution:** Modified import script to calculate these ratios from revenue and profit figures

### Issue 2: Field Name Casing Mismatch ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** API returns `epsDiluted` (camelCase) but script looked for `epsdiluted` (lowercase)  
**Solution:** Updated mapping to handle both naming conventions

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. Import Script (`scripts/import-fundamentals-to-supabase.ts`)

- ✅ Added automatic ratio calculations
- ✅ Fixed field name casing for `epsDiluted` and `ebitdaRatio`
- ✅ Handles missing fields gracefully

### 2. UI Component (`components/company/FinancialStatements.tsx`)

- ✅ Added null checks for profit margins
- ✅ Displays "N/A" instead of crashing when data is missing
- ✅ Conditionally renders EBITDA margin

## Test Results

### Before Fix

```
❌ grossProfitRatio: MISSING
❌ operatingIncomeRatio: MISSING
❌ netIncomeRatio: MISSING
❌ epsdiluted: MISSING
```

### After Fix

```
✅ grossProfitRatio: 0.4621 (46.2%)
✅ operatingIncomeRatio: 0.3151 (31.5%)
✅ netIncomeRatio: 0.2397 (24.0%)
✅ epsdiluted: 6.08
✅ ebitdaratio: 0.3444 (34.4%)
```

## How to Test

### Quick Test (recommended)

```bash
npm run test:income
```

This tests the FMP API response for AAPL, MSFT, and ABBV.

### Detailed Tests

```bash
# Test the fix
npx tsx scripts/test-income-statement-fix.ts

# Verify ratio calculations
npx tsx scripts/verify-income-ratios.ts

# Test end-to-end import
npx tsx scripts/test-single-import.ts
```

## How to Re-import Companies

If you have companies with old/incorrect data, re-import them:

```bash
npm run import:fundamentals
```

**Note:** Uses ~7 API calls per company. FMP free tier: 250 calls/day = ~35 companies/day
